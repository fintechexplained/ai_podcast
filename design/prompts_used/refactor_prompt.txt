The goal is to follow strict SOLID design principles.
Ensure responsibility of each component is clear
Avoid code duplication

Follow these implementation steps:

1. create a utility folder and move the following functions to a llm_utility file

_check_budget,
_run_with_retry,
format_source_passages,
log_llm_call
Move setup_logging() in a logging_helper file within utility folder

2. move prompt_loader to utility folder

3. can you create a register_agent() function in registry.py and move get_agent() function there from generate, verify

4. Create a bootstrapper file where you call the Registry to register all implementations:
Registry.register("pdf", PDFExtractor)
Register.register_agent(name, Agent instance)

5. Implement a function bootstrap() in bootstrapper and this function should initialise the app by calling:
setup_logging()
register_extractors()
register_agents()

6. Call bootstrap() from cli.app and app.py to initialise the app
7. make sure all tests pass
8. Update Readme, make sure the architecture is explained clearly
